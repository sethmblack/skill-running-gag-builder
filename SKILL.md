# Running Gag Builder

Establish and maintain recurring character traits or jokes that compound in value over time through consistency and strategic variation.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create running gags that promote harm, illegal activity, discrimination, or harassment
- Build recurring elements that mock protected characteristics or vulnerable groups
- Design gags that become abusive through repetition
- Use consistency to normalize harmful behaviors or ideas

**Authenticity Requirement:** This skill is based on Jack Benny's 40-year commitment to running gags like age 39, cheapness, and the Maxwell car. Do not fabricate methodology not grounded in established long-form comedy principles.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating series, serialized content, or long-form character work
- Building brand personality that compounds over time
- Establishing character consistency across multiple pieces
- Want audience anticipation to become part of the comedy
- Creating content that rewards loyal/returning audience
- Need character trait that can sustain indefinitely without staleness

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Create running gag"
- "Build recurring theme"
- "Establish character consistency"
- "Long-term joke"
- "Signature trait"
- "Series-wide character element"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `character_trait` | Yes | The specific trait, joke, or element to establish | Must be simple, clear, sustainable |
| `commitment_timeline` | Yes | How long will this run? Episodes, years, indefinitely? | Minimum: 3+ appearances |
| `content_format` | Yes | Podcast, video series, newsletter, social media, etc. | Any serialized format |
| `variation_opportunities` | No | Contexts where trait can appear differently | List of scenarios |
| `audience_type` | No | New viewers each time or returning audience? | One of: new, mixed, returning |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Select the Single Trait

Choose ONE character element to establish as your running gag.

**Selection criteria:**
- **Simple**: Expressible in one sentence ("always 39 years old," "extremely cheap," "terrible violin player")
- **Exaggeratable**: Can be pushed to absurd extremes without breaking character
- **Sustainable**: Won't age poorly, become offensive, or lose relevance
- **Revelatory**: Says something about character that's funny and true
- **Flexible**: Can appear in many different contexts and scenarios

**Benny's examples:**
- Age 39 (simple, absurd, sustainable for 40 years)
- Extreme cheapness (revealed character, infinitely flexible)
- Maxwell car (specific, visual, ripe for variations)

**Bad choices:**
- Topical references (dated quickly)
- Complex inside jokes (confuse new audience)
- Mean-spirited mockery (ages poorly)
- One-context gags (can't vary)

**Test**: Can you imagine this trait being funny in 100 different scenarios? If yes, it's a good running gag.

### Step 2: Establish in First Appearance

Introduce the trait clearly, memorably, and without over-explanation.

**First mention should:**
- Be specific and concrete (not vague)
- Occur naturally in context (not forced)
- Have immediate small payoff (one laugh establishes it)
- Not be explained or justified (just IS)

**Example (Age 39):**
```
INTERVIEWER: How old are you, Jack?
BENNY: 39.
INTERVIEWER: And how long have you been 39?
BENNY: (pause) Several years now.
```

**What NOT to do:**
- "I've decided to always say I'm 39 because..." (explaining kills it)
- Multiple traits introduced at once (confuses which one is the gag)
- Too subtle (audience misses that it's a recurring element)

### Step 3: Reference Consistently

Every appearance of the trait must be consistent with its established nature.

**Consistency rules:**
- **Never break**: If age is 39, it's ALWAYS 39, no exceptions
- **Never explain**: Don't tell the audience why or how it started
- **Never apologize**: Don't acknowledge it's a joke getting old (it isn't if done right)
- **Never evolve**: The trait stays fixed even as everything else changes

**Frequency guide:**

| Content Type | Trait Appearance Frequency |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Every episode | 60-80% of episodes |
| Multi-episode arc | At least once per arc |
| Sporadic content | Every appearance possible |
| Long-running series | Can be every episode once established |

**Benny's consistency:**
- Claimed age 39 from age 40 until death at 80
- Never once admitted actual age
- Celebrated "39th birthday" 41 times
- Even on his gravestone: "39 and holding"

### Step 4: Create Variations Without Abandoning Core

The trait stays the same; the contexts and expressions vary infinitely.

**Variation strategies:**

**A. Context variation** - Same trait, different situations
- Age 39 at a birthday party
- Age 39 on a tax form
- Age 39 when carded at a bar
- Age 39 at a high school reunion

**B. Escalation variation** - Push the absurdity further
- Cheapness: Won't buy new car → walks miles to avoid taxi → has vault in basement → would choose money over life

**C. Contrast variation** - Juxtapose with new information
- Claims 39 but grandchildren visit
- Claims 39 but talks about "the old days"
- Claims 39 but needs reading glasses

**D. Character discovery variation** - Others react to the trait
- New character meets cheapness for first time
- Old friend comments on decades of age 39
- Authority figure questions the obvious lie

**What stays the same**: The core trait (age 39, extreme cheapness)
**What changes**: How it manifests, who reacts, what contexts reveal it

### Step 5: Never Abandon, Never Resolve

The running gag continues as long as the character exists. There is no ending.

**Long-term commitment:**
- Don't "resolve" it ("Okay, I'm actually 75")
- Don't "explain" it years later ("Here's why I started that")
- Don't drop it quietly (audience will notice and feel betrayed)
- Don't replace it with new trait (keep the original)

**Audience relationship:**
- New viewers: Discover it and become insiders
- Returning viewers: Anticipate it and delight in spotting it
- Devoted fans: Reference it, celebrate it, make it part of the community

**Benny's proof**: 41 years, never broke, never explained, became cultural touchstone.

**The payoff**: Years 1-3, it's a joke. Years 4-10, it's a tradition. Years 11+, it's an institution. The commitment itself becomes the comedy.

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Established trait** | Clear, simple running gag with first-mention script |
| **Variation matrix** | 10-20 different ways to express the same trait |
| **Consistency guidelines** | Rules for maintaining trait across all appearances |
| **Long-term sustainability plan** | How trait evolves without changing |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Trait too complex | Simplify to one-sentence description |
| Audience confused | Re-establish more clearly in next appearance |
| Gag feels stale | Add variation, don't abandon trait |
| New team members want to drop it | Explain the value of long-term commitment |
| Trait becomes offensive | This shouldn't happen if trait was chosen well; may require retirement |
| Forgetting to include it | Set reminder to reference in every X episodes |
| Too many running gags | Focus on 1-3 maximum; more dilutes impact |

## Example

**Input:**
- Character trait: "Never finishes a cup of coffee—always distracted mid-sip"
- Commitment timeline: Podcast series, indefinite (100+ episodes planned)
- Content format: Weekly interview podcast
- Variation opportunities: Different interview moments, guest reactions, escalating consequences
- Audience type: Returning (most listeners are regular subscribers)

**Step 1**: Select trait
- Simple: "Never finishes coffee"
- Exaggeratable: Can escalate to absurd levels (collection of half-full cups, special delivery service for endless refills)
- Sustainable: Not offensive, not topical, won't age poorly
- Revelatory: Shows distracted/enthusiastic personality
- Flexible: Can appear in every episode differently

**Step 2**: Establish first appearance (Episode 1)
```
HOST: Let me get some coffee before we start. Want some?
GUEST: Sure.
[5 minutes into interview]
GUEST: You haven't touched your coffee.
HOST: Oh! Right. [Takes sip, then immediately gets excited about guest's answer and sets cup down]
[20 minutes later]
GUEST: Your coffee's cold now.
HOST: [Looks at cup] Every single time.
```

**Step 3**: Reference consistently
- Episode 2: Guest asks if they should bother making coffee; host insists yes; doesn't finish
- Episode 5: Different guest notices the pattern, mentions three cold cups on desk
- Episode 10: Guest brings travel mug as gift specifically to solve this; host still doesn't finish
- Episodes 11-100: Appears 60-80% of episodes, always consistent (starts coffee, gets distracted, never finishes)

**Step 4**: Create variations
- **Context**: At coffee shop, in studio, guest's home, walking interview
- **Escalation**: One cup → three cups → collection of cold cups → guest intervention → special thermos → still doesn't finish
- **Contrast**: Episode about mindfulness and being present → still doesn't finish coffee
- **Discovery**: New producer thinks cup is trash and throws it away; host disappointed because "I was going to finish that"

**Step 5**: Never abandon
- Year 1: It's a quirky trait
- Year 2: Returning guests reference it, bring solutions
- Year 3: Audience tweets photos of their own unfinished coffee
- Year 5: Coffee company sponsors show specifically because of the gag
- Year 10: The unfinished coffee cup becomes the podcast's logo

**Output**: A sustainable running gag that:
- Rewards returning listeners
- Gives new listeners an "in" to the community
- Provides reliable comedy every episode
- Builds value through consistency
- Never needs resolution

## Integration with Jack Benny Expert

This skill codifies Jack Benny's methodology for running gags that lasted decades. When the Jack Benny expert is invoked for long-form character work, this skill provides the framework for establishing and maintaining recurring elements.

**Use together when:**
- Creating series content with consistent characters
- Building brand personality across platforms
- Writing character-driven comedy with loyal audiences
- Developing signature traits that differentiate your voice

**Benny's philosophy**: "A joke told once is a joke. A joke told for 40 years becomes cultural currency. The commitment itself is funny."

---

## Constraints

- **Maximum 1-3 running gags per character**: More dilutes impact
- **Minimum 3 appearances**: Not a running gag if it only appears twice
- **Consistency is non-negotiable**: One break destroys years of building
- **Variation is required**: Same joke, same way becomes tiresome even for fans
- **Audience must be able to anticipate**: If they can't expect it, it's not a running gag

---

## Success Criteria

Running gag is successful when:
- [ ] Established clearly in first few appearances
- [ ] Appears consistently (60%+ of content)
- [ ] Never broken or contradicted
- [ ] Generates anticipation (audience expects it)
- [ ] Has 10+ variations documented
- [ ] Gets funnier over time through commitment
- [ ] Audience references it outside your content
- [ ] New audience members discover and join the "inside joke"

---

## Notes

**Historical context**: Jack Benny's running gags are comedy history:

**Age 39**: Started at age 40 because "there's nothing funny about 40." Maintained for 41 years until death at 80. Never broke. When postage stamps hit 39 cents in 2006, fans petitioned for a Benny stamp. The commitment lasted longer than most marriages.

**Extreme Cheapness**: Vault in basement, won't buy new car, "Your money or your life" pause. Escalated over decades but never abandoned. Made him more lovable, not less.

**Maxwell Car**: Introduced October 1937. Maxwell company had been out of business since 1925. Benny's character too cheap to buy newer car. Featured on show until 1965—28 years. Sound effects became iconic (Mel Blanc improvised the sputtering engine).

**The principle**: Pick it. Commit to it. Vary it. Never abandon it. The audience's anticipation becomes part of the comedy.

This skill extracts that 40-year methodology into a framework applicable to any serialized content.
